# Frontend Design Decisions

This document captures frontend-specific architectural decisions and their rationale.

## React 19 + Create React App: Modern Foundation

### Decision
Use React 19 with Create React App (CRA) as the foundation, configured as a Progressive Web App.

### Context
- Need rapid development with modern React features
- Want PWA capabilities for mobile-like experience
- Require good developer experience with hot reloading
- Must support cross-device compatibility

### Rationale
**React 19 Benefits:**
1. **Concurrent Features**: Improved performance and user experience
2. **Server Components**: Future-ready for SSR/SSG migration
3. **Enhanced Hooks**: Better state management and lifecycle handling
4. **Automatic Batching**: Improved performance out of the box

**CRA with PWA Template:**
1. **Quick Setup**: Zero configuration for initial development
2. **PWA Ready**: Service worker and manifest pre-configured  
3. **Build Optimization**: Automatic code splitting and optimization
4. **Developer Experience**: Hot reloading, error overlay, testing setup

### Trade-offs
- **Bundle Size**: CRA can produce larger bundles than custom setups
- **Configuration**: Limited customization without ejecting
- **Build Performance**: Slower builds compared to Vite/other tools

### Future Migration Path
- Consider Next.js for SSR/SSG when needed
- Evaluate Vite for faster development builds
- Migrate to custom Webpack config if advanced customization needed

## Proxy Configuration: Simplified Development

### Decision
Use CRA's built-in proxy for API requests during development.

### Implementation
```json
// package.json
"proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
```

### Rationale
1. **CORS Simplification**: No need for CORS configuration during development
2. **Environment Parity**: Same API paths in dev and production
3. **Simplicity**: Single configuration line vs complex proxy setup

### Production Difference
- Development: Frontend dev server proxies to backend
- Production: Frontend served from S3/CloudFront, direct API calls to API Gateway

## Component Architecture: Feature-Based Organization

### Decision
Organize components by feature/domain rather than technical type.

### Structure
```
src/
├── components/     # Shared/reusable components
├── pages/         # Top-level page components
├── contexts/      # React Context providers
├── services/      # API services and utilities
└── providers/     # App-level providers
```

### Rationale
1. **Domain Clarity**: Related functionality grouped together
2. **Scalability**: Easy to locate and modify feature-specific code
3. **Reusability**: Clear separation between shared and specific components
4. **Team Coordination**: Reduces merge conflicts in large teams (future)

### Component Naming Convention
- PascalCase for component files and names
- Descriptive names that indicate purpose
- Index files for clean imports

## State Management: Context API Strategy

### Decision
Use React Context API for global state management, avoiding external state libraries initially.

### Implementation Approach
```typescript
// AuthContext for authentication state
// UserContext for user profile data
// TaskContext for task-related state
// ThemeContext for UI preferences
```

### Rationale
1. **Simplicity**: Built-in React solution, no external dependencies
2. **Type Safety**: Easy integration with TypeScript
3. **Bundle Size**: No additional library weight
4. **Learning Curve**: Familiar to React developers

### When to Reconsider
- Complex state interactions across many components
- Performance issues from excessive re-renders
- Need for time-travel debugging
- Complex async state management requirements

### Future Options
- **Redux Toolkit**: For complex state management
- **Zustand**: Lightweight alternative with less boilerplate
- **Jotai**: Atomic state management approach

## Authentication Integration: AWS Cognito

### Decision
Integrate directly with AWS Cognito for authentication, storing JWT tokens in memory.

### Security Approach
- JWT tokens stored in React state (not localStorage)
- Automatic token refresh before expiration
- Secure logout that clears all authentication state
- HTTPS enforcement for all authentication flows

### Implementation Pattern
```typescript
const AuthProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [token, setToken] = useState(null);
  
  // Token refresh logic
  // Authentication state management
  // Logout functionality
};
```

### Rationale
1. **Security**: Memory storage prevents XSS token theft
2. **AWS Integration**: Native integration with Cognito
3. **Scalability**: Cognito handles user management complexity
4. **Features**: Ready for MFA, social login, password policies

### Trade-offs
- **Page Refresh**: User must re-authenticate on page reload
- **Multiple Tabs**: Authentication state not shared across tabs
- **Complexity**: More complex than simple username/password

## Mobile-First Responsive Design

### Decision
Design mobile-first with progressive enhancement for larger screens.

### Implementation
- Tailwind CSS for responsive utilities
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Progressive Web App features for mobile installation
- Responsive breakpoints: mobile → tablet → desktop

### Rationale
1. **User Experience**: Most household members likely use mobile devices
2. **Performance**: Mobile-first ensures good performance on constrained devices
3. **PWA Benefits**: App-like experience on mobile devices
4. **Future-Proofing**: Mobile usage trends continue to grow

### Responsive Strategy
```css
/* Mobile first (default) */
.task-card { /* mobile styles */ }

/* Tablet and up */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .task-card { /* tablet styles */ }
}

/* Desktop and up */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .task-card { /* desktop styles */ }
}
```

## PWA Configuration: Installable App Experience

### Decision
Configure as a Progressive Web App with offline capabilities and installation prompts.

### Features Enabled
- **Service Worker**: Caching for offline functionality
- **Web App Manifest**: Installation metadata and icons
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes
- **HTTPS**: Required for PWA features

### Current Limitations
- No offline data synchronization (future enhancement)
- Basic caching strategy (network-first for API, cache-first for assets)
- No push notifications (planned for future)

### Benefits
1. **Installation**: Users can install app on mobile home screen
2. **Performance**: Cached assets load faster
3. **Engagement**: App-like experience increases usage
4. **Accessibility**: Works without app store

## Error Handling: User-Friendly Error Management

### Decision
Implement comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages and fallback UI.

### Strategy
```typescript
// Error boundary for React component errors
// Service layer error handling for API failures
// Loading states and error states for all async operations
// Toast notifications for user feedback
```

### User Experience Approach
1. **Graceful Degradation**: App continues to work despite errors
2. **Clear Messaging**: User-friendly error messages, not technical details
3. **Recovery Options**: Clear paths for users to recover from errors
4. **Loading States**: Clear indication of app state during operations

### Implementation Levels
- **Component Level**: Error boundaries for component failures
- **Service Level**: API error handling and retry logic
- **User Level**: Toast notifications and error messaging
- **Application Level**: Global error handling and reporting

## Future Frontend Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- **Code Splitting**: Route-based and component-based splitting
- **Image Optimization**: WebP format, responsive images, lazy loading
- **Bundle Analysis**: Regular bundle size monitoring and optimization
- **Caching Strategy**: Advanced service worker caching patterns

### Enhanced PWA Features
- **Offline Support**: Offline task creation and synchronization
- **Push Notifications**: Task reminders and household updates
- **Background Sync**: Sync data when connection restored
- **Native Integration**: Share API, device contacts, camera

### Developer Experience
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration test suite
- **Storybook**: Component documentation and visual testing
- **TypeScript**: Stricter typing and advanced type patterns
- **Linting**: Enhanced ESLint rules and Prettier configuration
