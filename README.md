# Chore Garden

A task and chore management system.

An exercise in creating a table-stakes application - with infrastructure and core functionality that's robust enough for a commercial product. This can be used as a template to get a new application up and running very quickly.

For detailed information, see the top-level [documentation](./documentation/) folder, and the /documentation folders under each major section.

This repo uses a branch-based development flow:
- main : this is the production-deployed code (deployment via ci-cd manual trigger)
- dev : this is the development-deployed code (deployment via ci-cd trigger on merging a PR)
- - **generally, look at this branch to see the most recent work**
- working branches : these have the actively developed code for the various tasks, features, fixes, etc.
- - look at this to see work-in-progress
