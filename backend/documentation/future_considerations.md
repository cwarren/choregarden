# Backend Future Considerations

This document outlines planned enhancements and evolution paths for the Chore Garden backend.

## Near-Term 

### Enhanced Authentication & Authorization

**Current**: Basic JWT validation with Cognito  
**Potential**:
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- API key authentication for third-party integrations
- Session management and refresh token handling

### Background Job Processing

**Current**: Synchronous request processing  
**Potential**: BullMQ integration for async operations

**Use Cases**:
- Email notifications (task reminders, completion alerts)
- Data analytics processing
- Scheduled task generation
- Image processing for task photos
- Export generation (reports, data downloads)

**Architecture**:
```
API Endpoint → Queue Job → Background Worker → Database Update → WebSocket Notification
```

### API Versioning Strategy

**Current**: Single API version  
**Potential**: Versioned API with backward compatibility

**Implementation**:
- URL-based versioning: `/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/`
- Header-based version negotiation
- Deprecation warnings and migration guides
- Automated testing across versions

### Enhanced Error Handling

**Current**: Basic error responses  
**Potential**: Comprehensive error management

**Features**:
- Error correlation IDs for tracking
- Structured error logging with context
- Error rate monitoring and alerting
- User-friendly error messages with i18n support

## Medium-Term

### Database Optimization

**Query Optimization**:
- Database indexing strategy for common queries
- Query performance monitoring and optimization
- Connection pooling tuning for production load
- Read replica configuration for reporting queries

**Schema Evolution**:
- Database migration versioning and rollback procedures
- Zero-downtime migration strategies
- Data archiving for historical task data
- Partitioning strategy for large datasets

### Caching Layer

**Redis Integration**:
- Session caching for authenticated users
- API response caching for read-heavy endpoints
- Real-time data caching (active tasks, user status)
- Cache invalidation strategies

### Real-Time Features

**WebSocket Integration**:
- Real-time task updates across household members
- Live notification system
- Collaborative task editing
- Presence indicators (who's online)

**Server-Sent Events**:
- Push notifications for task reminders
- Progress updates for long-running operations
- System maintenance notifications

### API Documentation & Testing

**Enhanced OpenAPI**:
- Request/response examples for all endpoints
- Error response documentation
- Authentication flow documentation
- Rate limiting documentation

**Automated Testing**:
- Contract testing with frontend
- Performance testing and benchmarks
- Security testing (OWASP compliance)
- Load testing scenarios

## Long-Term

### Microservices Preparation

**Service Boundaries**:
```
User Service:     Authentication, user profiles, household management
Task Service:     Task definitions, assignments, scheduling
Analytics Service: Data processing, reporting, insights
Notification Service: Emails, push notifications, webhooks
```

**Migration Strategy**:
- Extract services gradually using strangler fig pattern
- Start with least coupled services (notifications, analytics)
- Implement service mesh for communication
- Event-driven architecture with message queues

### Advanced Features

**AI/ML Integration**:
- Smart task scheduling based on user patterns
- Predictive task completion times
- Intelligent task recommendations
- Anomaly detection for household patterns

**Advanced Analytics**:
- Time-series data for performance metrics
- Predictive analytics for household productivity
- Custom reporting and dashboard APIs
- Data export for business intelligence tools

### Performance & Scale

**Horizontal Scaling**:
- Stateless service design for load balancing
- Container orchestration (ECS/EKS optimization)
- Auto-scaling based on metrics (CPU, memory, queue depth)
- Database connection pooling at scale

**Global Distribution**:
- Multi-region deployment strategy
- CDN integration for API responses
- Regional data compliance (GDPR, CCPA)
- Cross-region replication and failover

## Technology Evolution

### Language & Framework Updates

**TypeScript Evolution**:
- Migrate to strict TypeScript configuration
- Advanced typing patterns (branded types, phantom types)
- Compile-time validation for configuration
- GraphQL schema generation from TypeScript types

**Framework Considerations**:
- Evaluate Fastify for performance improvements
- Consider Deno for enhanced security model
- GraphQL layer for flexible frontend queries
- gRPC for internal service communication

### Database Technology

**PostgreSQL Optimization**:
- Advanced indexing strategies (partial indexes, covering indexes)
- JSON/JSONB for flexible schema evolution
- Full-text search capabilities
- Time-series data optimization

**Alternative Considerations**:
- Redis for session and cache data
- Elasticsearch for advanced search features
- ClickHouse for analytics workloads
- TimescaleDB for time-series analytics

### Security Enhancements

**Advanced Security**:
- OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect full implementation
- API rate limiting with Redis backing
- Request signing for sensitive operations
- Audit logging for compliance requirements

**Compliance Preparation**:
- GDPR compliance features (data portability, deletion)
- SOC 2 compliance monitoring
- PCI DSS for payment processing
- HIPAA considerations for health-related features
