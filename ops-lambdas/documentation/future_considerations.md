# Ops-Lambdas Future Considerations

This document outlines potential enhancements and evolution paths for the operational Lambda functions.

## Near-Term

### Enhanced Error Handling and Notifications

**Current**: Basic CloudWatch logging and metrics  
**Potential**: Comprehensive operational alerting and recovery

**Enhanced Error Handling**:
TBD

**Notification Integration**:
- SNS integration for critical operational failures

- Lambda warmup strategies for scheduled operations
- Optimized container images with minimal dependencies

**Memory and Timeout Optimization**:
```hcl
# Right-sized Lambda configuration
resource "aws_lambda_function" "migration_lambda" {
  memory_size = 1024  # Optimized for database operations
  timeout     = 900   # 15 minutes for complex migrations
  
  # Reserved concurrency for predictable performance
  reserved_concurrent_executions = 5
}
```

**ARM64 Runtime Migration**:
- Evaluate ARM64 performance for database operations
- Cost-benefit analysis of ARM64 vs x86_64 runtimes
- Gradual migration starting with non-critical functions

## Decision Triggers

### When to Add Step Functions
- **Complexity**: Operational workflows require more than 3 sequential steps
- **Error Handling**: Need sophisticated retry and rollback logic
- **Visibility**: Require visual workflow monitoring and management
- **Coordination**: Multiple Lambda functions need orchestration

### When to Implement AI Enhancement
- **Pattern Recognition**: Clear patterns emerge in operational data
- **Automation Opportunity**: Repetitive operational decisions identified
- **Scale**: Volume of operational events justifies ML investment
- **Business Value**: AI-driven operations provide significant efficiency gains

### When to Add Multi-Region Support
- **Global Users**: User base spans multiple geographic regions
- **Compliance**: Data residency requirements drive regional deployment
- **Disaster Recovery**: Business continuity requires regional failover
- **Performance**: Regional operations improve response times

### Cost Management Triggers
- **Lambda Costs**: Monthly Lambda costs >$100 trigger optimization review
- **Execution Frequency**: Functions executing >1000 times/month need optimization
- **Cold Starts**: >500ms average cold start time requires performance optimization
- **Resource Utilization**: <50% memory utilization indicates over-provisioning
