latest done:
* AWS general set up (org, user(s))
* AWS CLI set up for local use (may already be working - it's been a while...)
* establish dev environment

next steps:
* validate tf networking by creating a temp ec2 instance that I can hit

longer term:
* use of terraform to create cg infrastructure
* first manual deploy
* deploy via ci-cd (to dev environment)
* add simple-but-not-trivial FE tests
