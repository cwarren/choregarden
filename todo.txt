latest done:
* API gateway up and running with ping and pingdeep working
* use of terraform to create cg infrastructure for FE
* first manual deploy of FE
* re-validate (& fix as needed) the local docker set up

next steps:
* validate the start-dev and stop-dev scripts (make sure they handle the API gateway and VPC link correctly)
* get the FE talking to the API

longer term:
* deploy FE via ci-cd (to dev environment)
* add simple-but-not-trivial FE tests
* set up db migration tool (flyway, probably)
* simple schema change via flyway (test/validation table and data)
* first manual deploy of DB
* implement schema update using flyway - manual
* deployment and migration via CI-CD
