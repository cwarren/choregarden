latest done:
* Cognito hosted UI for authentication - successful login and redirect to app home page
* create protected API endpoint (/api/pingprotected)
* FE status page has pings for the protected endpoint
* * in the nav bar, the log in button sends the user to a login page
* nav bar shows login control or link to user profile

next steps:
* create protect FE pages and sections on a page
* * user profile shows basic info (username / email) and has a logout button
* nav bar shows the email of the user, not the cognito ID
* get users tracked / registered in the application DB - basic user account table
* * migration to create the table
* * code in BE and maybe FE
* user profile has link to reset password


longer term:
* set up branch protection in github & shift workflow to branches and merges rather than direct commits (allow self-review, since solo, but add notes about it to README)
* iron out CI/CD for deployments & Terraform
* deploy FE via ci-cd (to dev environment)
* deploy BE via ci-cd (to dev environment)
* DB change deployment and migration via CI-CD (to dev environment)
* do a dev rollback (FE, BE, DB)
* implement / set up a prod environment
* do a prod deploy
* do a prod rollback (FE, BE, DB)
* create/implement invite-a-friend

docs/wiki/README
* development tooling set up
* AWS set up- basic org & account, initial terraform gotchas (set secrets, create ecr registries, etc.)
* running things locally using docker
* general workflow for FE update/deployment, and also BE and DB
* details of CI/CD flow
* architecture diagram
* scaling handles / levers
* logs & monitors
