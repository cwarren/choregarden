latest done:
* validate the start-dev and stop-dev scripts (make sure they handle the API gateway and VPC link correctly)
* get the FE talking to the API

next steps:
* add a pingdeep validation to the FE
* create a /status section of the site which has all the ping stuff

longer term:
* deploy FE via ci-cd (to dev environment)
* deploy BE via ci-cd (to dev environment)
* set up db migration tool (flyway, probably)
* simple schema change via flyway (test/validation table and data)
* implement schema update using flyway - manual
* deployment and migration via CI-CD
