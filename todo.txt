latest done:
*  user profile editing - basic name editing

in progress:
* implement user profile editing in the FE (and BE, if any changes are needed there)
* * clean up UI - show appropriate signals about what's editable or not


next steps:
* !! on refreshing the page on a non-root path, gives an error instead of refreshing as expected (locally, gives a 404' similar when deployed)

* * show the display name in the header instead of the login email address
* * allow display name to be edited (and update nav bar when that happens)

longer term:
* the backend is making DB queries directly with SQL - think about whether this is a decent approach for this case or whether it'd be better to use some sort of ORM
* set up branch protection in github & shift workflow to branches and merges rather than direct commits (allow self-review, since solo, but add notes about it to README)
* iron out CI/CD for deployments & Terraform
* deploy FE via ci-cd (to dev environment)
* deploy BE via ci-cd (to dev environment)
* DB change deployment and migration via CI-CD (to dev environment)
* do a dev rollback (FE, BE, DB)
* implement / set up a prod environment
* do a prod deploy
* do a prod rollback (FE, BE, DB)
* create/implement invite-a-friend

FE future considerations:
- **State Management**: Consider Redux Toolkit or Zustand for complex state
- **Data Fetching**: Add React Query for better server state management
- **TypeScript**: Migrate to TypeScript for better type safety
- **Testing**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
- **Performance**: Add code splitting and lazy loading for larger apps

tweaks & issues:
* on logging in, the log in button is still shown for a bit before the logged-in version of the header is shown, leading to an odd flicker experience
* on refreshing the page on a non-root path, gives an error instead of refreshing as expected:
