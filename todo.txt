latest done:
* add a pingdeep validation to the FE
* create a /status section of the site which has all the ping stuff
* set up db migration tool (flyway, probably)
* simple schema change via flyway (local test/validation table and data)

next steps:
* migration lambda (java, w/ flyway packages)
NEXT- got the lambda running locally using a local build; try again with the docker-based build now that there's a working model
* deploy schema update in AWS using migration lambda


longer term:
* deploy FE via ci-cd (to dev environment)
* deploy BE via ci-cd (to dev environment)
* deployment and migration via CI-CD
