latest done:
* make sure users updated_at is NOT updated just for setting last_login_at (if need be, pull that into a separate user_activities table, which may be useful anyway... though is log-ish so has HIGH growth potential)
* * and that it IS actually updated on login
* deploy FE and BE that have the dev logging cleaned out
* split up the BE code more, so it's not all in index.ts

in progress:

next steps:
* implement user profile editing in the FE (and BE, if any changes are needed there)
* * default the display name to the email address
* * show the display name in the header instead of the login email address
* * allow display name to be edited (and update nav bar when that happens)

longer term:
* the backend is making DB queries directly with SQL - think about whether this is a decent approach for this case or whether it'd be better to use some sort of ORM
* set up branch protection in github & shift workflow to branches and merges rather than direct commits (allow self-review, since solo, but add notes about it to README)
* iron out CI/CD for deployments & Terraform
* deploy FE via ci-cd (to dev environment)
* deploy BE via ci-cd (to dev environment)
* DB change deployment and migration via CI-CD (to dev environment)
* do a dev rollback (FE, BE, DB)
* implement / set up a prod environment
* do a prod deploy
* do a prod rollback (FE, BE, DB)
* create/implement invite-a-friend

tweaks:
* on logging in, the log in button is still shown for a bit before the logged-in version of the header is shown, leading to an odd flicker experience
* on refreshing the page on a non-root path, gives an error instead of refreshing as expected:
