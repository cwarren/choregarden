latest done:
* github CI/CD very basics working, sans DB

next steps:
* add DB stuff to ci-cd flow
* change all the usernames and passwords, now that relevant things are in secrets and .env's
* add simple-but-not-trivial BE tests
* * probably requires installing support packages
* add simple-but-not-trivial FE tests
* * probably requires installing support packages

longer term:
* AWS general set up (org, user(s))
* AWS CLI set up for local use (may already be working - it's been a while...)
* establish dev environment
* use of terraform to create cg infrastructure
* first manual deploy
* deploy via ci-cd (to dev environment)
