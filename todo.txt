latest done:
* add a pingdeep validation to the FE
* create a /status section of the site which has all the ping stuff
* set up db migration tool (flyway, probably)
* simple schema change via flyway (local test/validation table and data)

next steps:
* migration lambda (java, w/ flyway packages)
NEXT: manually deploy the migration lamda, update terraform (and other?) so manual input is no longer needed
* validate by deploying schema update in AWS using the migration lambda
* review things and automate what can be and other prep for CI/CD as needed

longer term:
* deploy FE via ci-cd (to dev environment)
* deploy BE via ci-cd (to dev environment)
* deployment and migration via CI-CD
